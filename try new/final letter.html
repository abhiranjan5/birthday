I have seen you go through a lot of emotions and pain, and it feels great to see u still smiling. well today you turn 22 well you still a 5year old in a 22-year-old body and look like a 15year old and the most important you are as careless as a little baby. But that‚Äôs what I am here for to take care of my stubborn baby. Well, I wanted to do something for you to make your day special but I wish I could actually do it in person but its fine wait for the right time. I want to see you happy you are just 22 you have long life ahead and hopefully a long life ahead with me. You are special and you deserve all the happiness you dream of. The most important thing is stay motivated and in case I mean somehow or maybe by chance you feel demotivated sad or any of your magical hormones hot you just remember you have someone (the most Pogi guy) that is me, I am with you and will always be. Happy birthday to my girlfriend / bebu /wife/bun bun/ cupcake /boss/master etc. And sorry I don‚Äôt have money for your gift ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Is it true? Use the magical work ‚Äì JADUGAR JAIRA APNA JADU DIKHAIYE...! 
                    I LOVE YOU SO MUCH MOR THEN THE NUMBER OF LETTER IN THIS LETTER‚ù§Ô∏è- Your Hun
